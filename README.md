# Present
A small nodejs/js presentation software built to avoid using PowerPoint/KeyNote and run it from any browser.
Hacked together in a day to present how my internship went.
NodeJS is used as a server to serve the site and send slide content to browser using ws.
The frontend is a HTML canvas running js with some simple animations and io.
